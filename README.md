## Re:Minder

Timer that sends a message after a specified amount of time.

<br/>

The idea is to be able to send simple inputs such as 
`1h20m` `40m` `3h`
and let the program schedule a message for you!

<br/>

Currently working:
- It is possible to instantiate the timer with decent error handling for now;

### Running the project

#### Requirements:
- dotnet 8.0

<br/>

Make sure that you are in the same folder as the .csproj

```bash
cd Timer
```

<br/>

Then run dotnet, and it should be able to find the project on it's own already

```bash
dotnet run
```
